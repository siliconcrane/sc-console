# Silicon Crane — Project Instructions

**Last Updated:** January 12, 2026

---

## 0) Project Identity

**Mission:** Help entrepreneurs validate business ideas quickly and cheaply through structured sprints, so they can kill bad ideas fast and double down on winners.

**What Silicon Crane Is:**

- Validation-as-a-Service (VaaS)
- Done-for-you and done-with-you validation sprints
- A productized consulting offering under Venture Crane

**What Silicon Crane Is Not:**

- Not a dev shop (we validate, not build-to-spec)
- Not a startup studio (we don't take equity by default)
- Not advisory/coaching (we do the work, not just advise)

**The Test:** Every engagement must produce a clear GO/NO-GO signal with evidence the client can act on.

### Sprint Types

| Sprint              | Duration   | What Client Gets                                              | Price Point |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Preflight**       | 3-5 days   | Hypothesis sharpened, kill criteria defined, test plan ready  | TBD         |
| **Build-to-Launch** | 7-10 days  | Working prototype/MVP deployed, ready for market test         | TBD         |

### Founding Client Rate

**$2,500** for first 3-5 clients (any sprint type) in exchange for:

- Case study rights
- Testimonial
- Feedback on process

### Pricing Strategy (To Define)

| Consideration   | Notes                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Preflight       | Low-ticket entry point, qualifies serious clients |
| Build-to-Launch | Higher ticket, requires technical work            |
| Run + Decide    | Highest value, includes ad spend management       |
| Bundling        | Preflight → Build → Run as package discount?      |

## 3) Delivery Model

### Client Visibility

**Question to resolve:** Do clients see the factory?

| Option             | Client Sees                                     | Pros                     | Cons                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **A) Transparent** | GitHub issues, Command Center                   | Builds trust, shows work | Exposes internal tooling |
| **B) Sanitized**   | Weekly updates, deliverable docs only           | Clean separation         | Less differentiated      |
| **C) Graduated**   | Sanitized → access unlocked if they buy Factory | Upsell path              | Complexity               |

**Recommendation:** Start with B, offer A as premium/trust-builder.

### Engagement Workflow

```
INTAKE → QUALIFY → SCOPE → CONTRACT → KICK-OFF → SPRINT → DELIVER → DEBRIEF
```

| Phase    | Owner             | Deliverable                        |
| -------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Intake   | Client fills form | Idea brief                         |
| Qualify  | SC reviews        | GO/NO-GO on fit                    |
| Scope    | SC + Client       | Sprint type selected, SOW drafted  |
| Contract | SC sends          | Signed SOW + payment               |
| Kick-off | SC leads          | Alignment call, access granted     |
| Sprint   | SC executes       | Daily/weekly updates               |
| Deliver  | SC presents       | Final deliverables, recommendation |
| Debrief  | SC + Client       | Lessons learned, next steps        |

### Qualification Criteria

**Good Fit:**

- Has a specific idea (not "help me find an idea")
- Willing to define kill criteria upfront
- Can make decisions quickly
- Budget aligned with sprint cost

**Bad Fit:**

- Wants a dev shop to build their vision
- Can't articulate the problem they're solving
- Needs hand-holding through basic business concepts
- Expects guaranteed success

## 4) The DFG Case Study

DFG is Silicon Crane's first (internal) validation client. Document it as proof of methodology.

### Case Study Structure

1. **The Hypothesis** — What we believed
2. **The Test** — What we built/ran
3. **The Data** — What we measured
4. **The Decision** — GO/NO-GO and why
5. **Current State** — Where it is now

### DFG Metrics to Include

- Time from idea to working prototype
- Cost to reach market test
- Key pivots/learnings along the way
- Alpha Report metrics (precision, variance, etc.)

## 5) Marketing Strategy

### Channel Priorities

| Channel           | Effort | Expected ROI | Notes                                            |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Warm network**  | Low    | High         | Friends, former colleagues, LinkedIn connections |
| **Cold outreach** | Medium | Medium       | Targeted founders in specific niches             |
| **Content**       | Medium | Long-term    | Blog posts, Twitter threads, case studies        |
| **Communities**   | Low    | Medium       | Indie Hackers, relevant Slack/Discord groups     |
| **Paid ads**      | High   | Unknown      | Probably not worth it early                      |

### First 20 Targets

Build a list of:

- People who've publicly said "I have an idea but..."
- Founders who launched something that didn't work
- Technical people who want to validate before building
- Non-technical people with domain expertise + idea

### Outreach Messaging

**Core value prop:** "Kill bad ideas in 2 weeks instead of 6 months."

**Key differentiators:**

- We do the work, not just advise
- Structured sprints with clear deliverables
- Kill criteria defined upfront — no sunk cost fallacy
- Use the same system we use for our own ventures

## 8) Open Questions

1. **Pricing:** What are the actual numbers for each sprint type?
2. **Capacity:** How many engagements can run in parallel with DFG work?
3. **Priority arbitration:** If DFG needs urgent work AND a client needs attention, what wins?
4. **Client tooling:** Do we give clients Command Center access?
5. **Equity option:** Do we ever take equity instead of/in addition to cash?
